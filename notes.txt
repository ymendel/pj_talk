# talking about playlists, not djing

Once you're done with a dj set, you have a playlist. This can be used for future reference

# at the end, reminder once again that all this relates to making playlists, not djing
# making playlists : djing :: ____ : ____   monologue : conversation
#  or more audience-appropriate
# waterfall : agile

mix tapes/mix CDs # (show repeated-word band names list)

talk about different versions, standards
Sweet Georgia Brown (Bechet, Ella, Brother Bones)

flying home (lionel hampton) (194 - from Big Band Jazz) -> Basie (Jumpin' at the Woodside - Decca)
another version of flying home (still lionel hampton) (162 - from Big Band Leaders) -> other Basie (One O'Clock Jump - Anthology)

note: Depending on what you're going for, either flying home can be followed by either Basie, or even either basie to flying home (but 234->162 is a big, big drop)
